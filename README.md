# Proposal for HAND-IN HAND-OUT
- Every year universities tend to hand out textbooks to students for their respective courses. If in case of books shortage or books being damaged or other reasons the university tend to ask students to buy textbooks from other sources. After the year is done most of these books are either sold on other websites or students tend to recycle them. We intend to create an application to allow students to sell these books to the university on a certain percentage of the actual price so these books can be again issued by the university for new students.

- We are proposing the technology stack based on JAVA with spring, and the front end with Angular.
- It is a fully optimized frame work which helps to maintain and modify requirements.
